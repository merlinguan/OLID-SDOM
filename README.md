This is the supplementary software of Optical Lock-in Detection Super-resolution Dipole Orientation Mapping (OLID-SDOM) which is being submitted. This method can analyse the orientation mapping of low fluorescence polarization sample, and provide a high signal to noise ratio than conventional Fluorescent polarization microscopy. This program is based on SDOM(https://github.com/KarlZhanghao/SDOM).

See the "program description" for usage detail.
